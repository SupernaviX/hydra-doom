          <p>
            Hydra Doom is a technology demonstration showcasing one of Cardano’s
            scaling solutions called Hydra using the shareware levels of the
            1993 id software game Doom.
          </p>
          <p>
            While you are playing, the game states will be streamed into a Hydra
            head, which uses Cardano smart contracts to validate the game
            transition for every frame, in real time. It’s a passion project put
            together by a small team, including Sundae Labs, Adam Dean, and a
            few folks from IOG, in a short amount of time. All the code is fully
            open sourced.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hydra Doom is intended as a light-hearted tech demo and is not a
            commercial product.
